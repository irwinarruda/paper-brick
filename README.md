# <img src="./src/assets/logo-filled.png" height="45px" align="center" /> Paper Brick

A macOS app that helps users change their desktop wallpapers quickly.

**Paper Brick** is a small project created for me to enhance the process of changing desktop wallpapers. I found navigating through system settings to alter wallpapers unnecessarily time-consuming. To address this, I developed **Paper Brick** as a convenient **System Tray** menu. This design choice eliminates the need to constantly open and minimize windows, making it faster to change wallpapers.

  <img width="400px" src="./src/assets/dark-theme.png" />
  <img width="400px" src="./src/assets/light-theme.png" />
</p>

With the app, you can:

- Chose a directory so that the app can scan all its image files;
- See thumbnails from all the scanned images;
- Select the new wallpaper by clicking an image.

### Technologies

This was a simple project. It helped me learn more about SolidJS, and discover new desktop solutions outside of Electron. For this project, I used:

- [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) for the desktop layer;
- [Solid JS](https://www.solidjs.com/) for the UI;
- [Solid Icons](https://solid-icons.vercel.app/) for the icons;
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling;
- [i18n](https://www.i18next.com/) for internationalization.
